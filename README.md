## Overview

Every `ch<n>/part-<n>` is a self contained project. Each builds on the last, incrementally adding functionality and behavior.

The preferred generator is `Ninja Multi-Config` to keep examples consistent across Windows, macOS and Linux. Feel free to use an alternative generator if desired.
